# STATS-507-projects

The purpose of this repository is to document my coursework and project work for STATS 507 at the University of Michigan in Fall 2025.

STATS 507: Data Science and Analytics Using Python provides an introduction to the Python programming language and the various Python libraries (such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc). This course also covers git and SQL, for working with data within databases. Finally, this course provides a brief introduction to deep learning using PyTorch.
